					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Hello, I’m Sky Carver! My journey has always been guided by a passion for creating elegant, innovative spaces that foster community and connection. One of my greatest joys is hosting dinners in my home, bringing together friends, old and new, for meaningful conversations and shared meals.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently, after crossing into my 60s, I started reimagining how I want to live the next chapter of my life. A longtime fan of longevity and modern health breakthroughs, I’ve spent a lot of time researching the “Blue Zones”—unique places where people live vibrant, healthy lives well into their later years. Inspired by these insights and my passion for gathering people, the idea for Riverhaven was born.
						</p>
						<p>
							Riverhaven is a community envisioned for those who value an active, health-focused lifestyle in a supportive and inspiring environment. It’s a place where like-minded people can support each other in living life to the fullest.
						</p>
