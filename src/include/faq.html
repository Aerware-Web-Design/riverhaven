				<h3>What is cohousing?</h3>
				<p>
					Cohousing is a type of collaborative housing in which residents actively participate in the design and operation of their own neighborhoods. Cohousing residents are consciously committed to living as a community. The physical design encourages both social contact and individual space.

				<h3>How is home ownership legally structured in cohousing communities?</h3>
				<p>
					Riverhaven is currently exploring the best options for structuring home ownership in our cohousing cooperative. In communities like ours, ownership is often set up through individual ownership with shared common areas (similar to condominiums), collective ownership through a cooperative, or individual ownership of homes with shared spaces managed by a homeowners’ association (HOA). We are committed to choosing a structure that supports a connected and thriving community and will update everyone as we finalize our plans.

				<h3>What is the planned layout for the units and common areas at Riverhaven?</h3>
				<p>
					We are envisioning a main structure with multiple units, each featuring its own garage, kitchenette, and private bathroom, though these details are still being finalized. Plans include a shared kitchen and dining area, along with potential communal spaces like a garden. We’re currently working with an architect to develop designs and will keep our followers updated as plans take shape.

				<h3>Can you tell me more about the property and land?</h3>
				<p>
					The Riverhaven property spans approximately 2/3 of an acre with direct waterfront access to the Kenai River in Soldotna. Nestled within a secluded subdivision, it is surrounded by 210 acres of protected land, offering residents a serene, nature-rich environment. The land features walking trails that meander along the river and through breathtaking old-growth forests, creating perfect opportunities for outdoor activities, reflection, and exercise—all essential elements of a wellness-focused lifestyle.
