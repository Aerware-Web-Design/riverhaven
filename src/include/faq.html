				<h3>What is a co-op?</h3>
				<p>
					A co-op is a type of collaborative housing in which residents actively participate in the design and operation of their own neighborhoods. Residents are consciously committed to living as a community. The physical design encourages both social contact and individual space.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>How is home ownership legally structured in co-op communities?</h3>
				<p>
					Riverhaven is a cooperative. In communities like ours, ownership is set up through individual ownership with shared common areas (similar to condominiums), collective ownership through a cooperative, and individual ownership of homes with shared spaces managed by a homeowners’ association (HOA). We are committed to a structure that supports a connected and thriving community.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Is Riverhaven a retirement community or assisted living?</h3>
				<p>
					No. Riverhaven is for active, independent people of all ages. We’re not a care facility—we’re a cooperative neighborhood for those who want simplicity, wellness, and optional community.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>What is the planned layout for the units and common areas at Riverhaven?</h3>
				<p>
					Riverhaven will feature a main structure with multiple units, each including a kitchenette and private bathroom. Optional garages will be available based on resident preferences. The community will also include a shared kitchen and dining area, along with a variety of thoughtfully designed communal spaces such as a garden, greenhouse, sauna, gym, and an outdoor atrium with a BBQ area, fire pit, and gazebo. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Can you tell me more about the property and land?</h3>
				<p>
					The Riverhaven property spans approximately 2/3 of an acre with direct waterfront access to the Kenai River in Soldotna. Nestled within a secluded subdivision, it is surrounded by 210 acres of protected land, offering residents a serene, nature-rich environment. The land features walking trails that meander along the river and through breathtaking old-growth forests, creating perfect opportunities for outdoor activities, reflection, and exercise—all essential elements of a wellness-focused lifestyle.
				</p>

			<li>
				<h3>What is cooperative ownership?</h3>
				<p>
					Each household buys a share in the cooperative and receives exclusive rights to their unit. Major decisions are pre-made in the Bylaws, minor decisions about maintenance responsibilities as well as usage priorities, common area activities, improvements and other governing principles are shared, reducing costs and complexity.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes! We welcome well-behaved pets that fit the cooperative guidelines.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>What are the monthly fees?</h3>
				<p>
					Fees cover snow removal, landscaping, insurance, shared utilities, and reserves for maintenance, as well as a special 1st mortgage that pays down over time to provide equity to home owners for future use.  Specific numbers are available upon request. We are estimating approximately $950 per month at this time for ease of owners time and concerns. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Can anyone purchase a home?</h3>
				<p>
					No. Co-ops are normally organized by a cooperative system of users with like minded values. We welcome honest disagreements but not entrenched points of view. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Can the units be rented to others?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, there is a screening process with other owners voting for approval of tenants.
